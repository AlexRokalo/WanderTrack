## Technical Implementation

### Jetpack Compose
- **User Interface:** WanderTrack will utilize Jetpack Compose for building its user interface, providing a modern and responsive UI design. This declarative toolkit simplifies UI development and ensures a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Coroutines
- **Asynchronous Operations:** To handle asynchronous tasks such as fetching location data, saving routes, and processing user inputs efficiently, WanderTrack will leverage Kotlin Coroutines. This allows for smooth and non-blocking operations, enhancing the overall performance of the app.

WanderTrack is an essential tool for all travel enthusiasts, providing convenient tools for planning, tracking, and sharing their adventures. By leveraging Jetpack Compose for a modern UI and Coroutines for efficient asynchronous operations, WanderTrack ensures a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
